# ASmartMusicRecommender
Recommend music based on sound analysis instead of author/genre, using a .jar application.

- Developer link appears to be dead. Just install jdk 20, open IntelliJ, clone the project, open the Maven tab, run "package" (will take a few minutes), then run either one of the .jar files it builds in the "target" folder.

Goals:
- Analyze music using only the objective information contained in a sound file.
- Link users to matching songs.
