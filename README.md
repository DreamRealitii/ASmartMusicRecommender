Recommend music based on sound analysis instead of author/genre, using a .jar application.

- Developer link appears to be dead. Just install jdk 20, open IntelliJ, clone the project, build, and run. Hopefully it will work.

Goals:
- Analyze music using only the objective information contained in a sound file.
- Link users to matching songs.
