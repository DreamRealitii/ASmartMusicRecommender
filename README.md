# ASmartMusicRecommender
Recommend music based on sound analysis instead of author/genre.

Goals:

- Link users to matching songs.

Code Layout:
- Backend
    - Analysis - The different types of analysing each song, such as Spotify or our own analysis.
    - Algorithm - Our custom sound analysis algorithm and the math used in it.
    - Spotify - Interact with Spotify API to get their analysis of music, create playlists for user.
    - Helper - Classes that help with miscellaneous functions, like parsing Json and .mp3 files.
- Frontend
    - UI - The visual organization of the program.
    - Control - How the program responds to user input.
    - Graphics - Images and fonts used in the program.

- If it opens spotify in your browser the password is "password123"
- Then you copy the Spotify track ID as shown on the app.
- The results will show up in your IntelliJ console.
- The links in the console are the links that will take you to the song in Spotify.
