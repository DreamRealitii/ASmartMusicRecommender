Team Report:
- Rough fourier transform is working.
  - +Balanced: Given white noise returns equal amplitudes for all frequencies.
  - -Slow: Runs about 4x the speed of playing the sound.
  - -Inaccurate: A single tone leaks some amplitude into the entire audible sound spectrum.
  - -First attempt to solve the two issues using a variable "window length" made the results imbalanced, so it was not committed.
- Meeting Agenda:
  - Hope Gursameep shows up so Ethan can show him how to add his name to the team member list for the class website.
  - Discuss UI.
- Goals:
  - Backend:
    - Write tests for functionality that isn't dependent on external behavior (like Spotify servers and MP3 library).
    - Create non-empty Spotify playlist.
    - Continue working on sound analysis.
  - Frontend:
    - Create main menu.
